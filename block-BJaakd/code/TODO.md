1. Create a promise. Have it resolve with a value of `Promise Resolved!` in resolve after a delay of 1000ms, using `setTimeout`. Print the contents of the promise after it has been resolved by passing `console.log` to `.then`

```js
// Your code

 let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     setTimeout(resolve(`Promise Resolved`), 1000);
 }).then(value => console.log(value));
```

2. Create another promise. Now have it reject with a value of `Rejected Promise!` without using `setTimeout`. Print the contents of the promise after it has been rejected by passing console.log to `.catch`

```js
let rejPro = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject(`Rejected Promise!`);
}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

3. Create another promise. Now have it reject with a value of `Rejected Promise!` without using `setTimeout`. Print the contents of the promise after it has been rejected by passing console.log to `.catch` and also use `.finally` to log message `Promise Settled!`.

```js
// Your code
let rejPro2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject('Rejected Promise!');
}).catch((value) => console.log(value)).finally(() => console.log('Promise settled!'));
```

4. What will be the output of the code below.

```js
console.log('A');

// Asynchronous code finises in 0 seconds (Callback Queue)
setTimeout(() => console.log('B'), 0); // callback queue

// A promise that resolves right away (Microtask Queue)
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('C'));

console.log('D');

// Output:
A
D
C
B
```


5. Write a function named `wait` that accepts `time` in ms returns a promise. The promise gets resolved after given time.

```js
// Your code
function wait(time) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve(), time);
    }); 
}
```

6. Do the following:

- Create a new promise
- Resolve with 21
- Use `.then` and return adding `10` to the value you will get as parameter
- Use `.then` and return adding `100` to the value you will get as parameter
- Use `.then` and check if the value you get is greater than `100` throw new error with any message
- Catch the error using `.catch`

```js
// Your code
let newPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        resolve(21);
}).then((val) => val+10)
  .then((val) => val + 100)
  .then((val) => { 
      if(val > 100){
          throw new Error('Something went wrong');
      }
      })
   .catch ((error) => console.log(error));   
```

7. Do the following:

- Create a new promise
- Resolve the promise with `['A']`
- Use `.then` and concat `B` into the parameter and return
- Use `.then` and return and object like `{0: 'A', 1: 'B'}`
- Use `.then` and log the value

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve(['A']);
}).then((val) => { val.push('B')
                   return val})
  .then((val) => {
      let obj = {};
      val.forEach((elm, index) => {
          obj[index] = elm;
      }      
  )
  return obj;
})
  .then((val) => console.log(val));    
```

8. Do the following:

- Create a new promise named `first` and resolve it with `1`
- Use `.then` on `first` and return `2` also check the value you get access to by logging
- Chain `.then` on above and return `3` also check the value you get access to by logging
- Chain `.then` on above and return `4` also check the value you get access to by logging

```js
let first = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve(1);
}).then(val => 
    {
        console.log(val);
        return 2;
    }    
    )
   .then(val => 
    {
        console.log(val);
        return 3;
    }    
    ) 
   .then(val => 
    {
        console.log(val);
        return 4;
    }    
    ); 

    // Output
    1
    2
    3

```

9. Do the following:

- Create a new promise named `first` and resolve it with `1`
- Use `.then` on `first` and return `2` also check the value you get access to by logging
- Use `.then` on `first` and return `3` also check the value you get access to by logging
- Use `.then` on `first` and return `4` also check the value you get access to by logging

```js
let first = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve(1);
})

first.then(val => 
    {
        console.log(val);
        return 2;
    }    
    )
  first .then(val => 
    {
        console.log(val);
        return 3;
    }    
    ) 
  first .then(val => 
    {
        console.log(val);
        return 4;
    }    
    ); 

    // Output
    1
    1
    1
```

10. Try to understand the difference between the problem 8 and 9. Write your observation.  

   In `problem 8` then is chained one after the other. 
   In `problem 8` then is called on first all the time, no chaining happens. 

11. Do the following

- Create a promise and resolve it with `John`
- Use `.then` and return another promise that resolves with `Arya`
- Use `.then` log the value you get access to and return another promise that resolves after 2000ms with value `Bran`
- Use `.then` to log the value

```js
// Your code

let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve('John');
});

let promise1 = promise.then(() => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve('Arya');
}))

let promise2 = promise.then(() => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve('Bran'), 2000);
})).then ((val) => console.log(val));
```
